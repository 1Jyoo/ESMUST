# ESMUST

This is a repository to share an outcome model of the journal paper (ESMUST: EnergyPlus-driven surrogate model for urban surface temperature prediction).

## Description

This study presents a new urban surface temperature prediction model called the EnergyPlus-driven surrogate model for urban surface temperature (ESMUST). 
ESMUST was built using artificial neural networks with 42 million entries of a synthetic dataset and thirteen input features. 
During the validation process, ESMUST achieved 0.964 percent bias and efficiently predicted the surface temperature of 3D urban models with fewer inputs.

ESMUST was built using C# coding and operated in Autodesk Revit Dynamo tool.
